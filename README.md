This repository contains my attempt at solving the Astroinformatics homework for "Introduction to AstroStatistics and Big Data in Astronomy" by Darko Jevremović, taught in Fall 2018.

The questions for this homework were taken from the following GitHub repository: (https://github.com/astromundus/astroinfo2018/tree/master/homework)

Feel free to explore my solutions and provide any feedback or suggestions. Thank you!
